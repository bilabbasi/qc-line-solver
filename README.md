# Level set convex hulls using a line-solver  

$F[u]$

## Getting Started

There are two folders: matlab and python. Each folder has (analogously) written code in each language.

### Python

All of the needed functions are contained in the *linesolver.py*.

### Matlab

Use *ndim_linesolver.m* to generate convex hulls of a given obstacle *g*.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
