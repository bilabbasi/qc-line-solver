# Level set convex hulls using a line-solver  


## Getting Started

There are two folders: matlab and python. Each folder has (analogously) written code in each language.

### Python

All of the needed functions are contained in the *linesolver.py*. In particular, use *quasiconvex_rotate* to compute the quasiconvex envelope along a given slope (including it's rotation).

### Matlab

Use *ndim_linesolver.m* to generate convex hulls of a given obstacle *g*.
